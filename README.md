# Xpert Learning Assistant was used when I needed assistance with portions of the assignment.

# Write down your prediction in the designated cells in your Jupyter Notebook, and provide justification for your educated guess.

# I think the Random Forest Classifier model will perform better than the Logistic Regression model because Random Forest Classifier has performed better than Logistic Regression in class activities.



# Which model performed better?

# The Random Forest Classifier model, with an accuracy score of 0.9565689467969598 performed better than the Logistic Regression model which had an accuracy score of 0.9196525515743756.



# How does that compare to your prediction?

# This matches what I predicted before running the models.
